This is a C++ 2D game project using raylib. Use modern C++ best practices and keep code modular.

When suggesting code using raytmx library, consider example code from https://github.com/luphi/raytmx/blob/main/example/raytmx-example.c.

Use explanation comments require multiple lines, use multiline comments instead of single-line comments.

Add doxygen-style comments for public methods and classes.

When suggesting code, ensure it is compatible with C++17 standards.

Each routine should have only one return point - being an explicit return at the end of the function.

Do not use one letter variable names.
